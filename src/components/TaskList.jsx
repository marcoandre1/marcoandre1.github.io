        My name is ModokemDev. I am enthusiast web developer. I spend some of my
        time learning technologies, mainly for fun, but also to be a better
        developer.

        Oh man it's hard to keep track of everything. But here is what I can
        remember. My first experience was probably at primary school with
        something called Scratch ðŸ˜º. I think it is still around. As a child, I
        remember my dad giving me a book to learn Visual Basic (Yes, I know
        ...ðŸ™„). The book came with a floppy disk ðŸ’¾ (I am not that old...). When
        I was a teenager I took some classes to learn Visual Basic, MySQL and
        C++. I forgot most of it to be honest. Don't ask me why but I ended up
        studying chemistry at university. I call this the dark times. I
        officially started my developer journey when I got into software
        engineering at university.
